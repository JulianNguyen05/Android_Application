# LamThem_TOEIC_600_Vocabulary_Learning

This project is a practical implementation of a modern Android flashcard application, demonstrating how to effectively use **`ViewPager2`** and **`FragmentStateAdapter`** to create an efficient, swipe-based learning experience. The app is pre-loaded with around 100 essential TOEIC vocabulary words, serving as a real-world dataset.

The core of this application is not just the content, but the architecture that powers the user interface. It showcases how `ViewPager2`, built on the powerful engine of `RecyclerView`, is the ideal choice for paged content.

## üß† Core Implementation: Building with ViewPager2

This project was built to leverage the modern capabilities of `ViewPager2`, which offers significant advantages over the original `ViewPager` by being built upon `RecyclerView`. This provides superior memory management through view recycling and enhanced flexibility.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Setting Up the `ViewPager2` in the Layout**

The foundation is a `ViewPager2` widget in `activity_main.xml`, which acts as the container for our swipeable fragments.

**`activity_main.xml`**

```xml
<androidx.viewpager2.widget.ViewPager2
    android:id="@+id/word_viewpager"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="0dp"
    android:padding="16dp"
    app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf="@id/tvHeader"
    app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="parent"/>
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Connecting Data with `FragmentStateAdapter`**

The `WordCardAdapter` is the brain of the operation. It extends `FragmentStateAdapter`, the standard choice for using Fragments with `ViewPager2`. Its job is to efficiently provide a `WordCardFragment` for each `Word` object in our list.

**`WordCardAdapter.java`**

```java
public class WordCardAdapter extends FragmentStateAdapter {
    private List<Word> wordList;

    public WordCardAdapter(@NonNull FragmentActivity fragmentActivity, List<Word> wordList) {
        super(fragmentActivity);
        this.wordList = wordList;
    }

    @NonNull
    @Override
    public Fragment createFragment(int position) {
        // Create a new Fragment instance for the given position
        Word word = wordList.get(position);
        return WordCardFragment.newInstance(word);
    }

    @Override
    public int getItemCount() {
        // The total number of pages is the size of our word list
        return wordList.size();
    }
}
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Managing UI State within a Fragment**

Each flashcard is a self-contained `WordCardFragment`. The "tap-to-reveal" feature demonstrates how UI state can be managed within each fragment independently. This logic is simple, efficient, and doesn't require complex communication with the hosting Activity.

**`WordCardFragment.java`**

```java
LinearLayout cardContainer = view.findViewById(R.id.cardContainer);

cardContainer.setOnClickListener(v -> {
    // Check the current visibility of a detail view
    boolean isDetailsVisible = tvMeaning.getVisibility() == View.VISIBLE;
    
    // Toggle between GONE and VISIBLE
    int newVisibility = isDetailsVisible ? View.GONE : View.VISIBLE;

    tvType.setVisibility(newVisibility);
    tvMeaning.setVisibility(newVisibility);
    tvExample.setVisibility(newVisibility);
});
```

## ‚ú® Key Technical Features

  - **Efficient View Recycling**: By leveraging the `RecyclerView` engine, `ViewPager2` only keeps a few fragments in memory at once, allowing it to handle hundreds or thousands of pages with minimal performance impact.
  - **Fragment Lifecycle Management**: `FragmentStateAdapter` correctly handles the lifecycle of each fragment, saving and restoring its state as you swipe.
  - **Modularity**: Each flashcard is an independent `Fragment`, making the code clean, easy to maintain, and scalable.
  - **Smooth Animations**: Page transformations and data updates (if implemented with `DiffUtil`) are handled smoothly by the underlying `RecyclerView` animator.

  * **Left ‚Äì Initial Fragment State:** The `WordCardFragment` is first displayed with only the primary data visible.
  * **Right ‚Äì Toggled Fragment State:** After a click event, the fragment updates its own UI to reveal additional information.
