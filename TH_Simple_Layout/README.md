# 📱 TH Simple Layout UI

This is an Android application built with **Java** in **Android Studio**, showcasing a single-page **Sign Up UI** faithfully recreated from the original [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/OfwHhZbvlj9otXUpt6lRnA/Simple-Login-%E2%9C%A8--Community-?node-id=92-209&t=2E  lsI3S8WSVqebHb-0).  
The project focuses entirely on **interface design**, without any backend or business logic.

## 🚀 Introduction
This application demonstrates how to implement a **modern Sign Up screen** in Android, using:

- **ConstraintLayout** for a flexible and responsive layout structure.  
- **Material Components** (`TextInputEditText`, `Button`) aligned with Material Design guidelines.  
- **Custom fonts and icons** to ensure visual consistency with the Figma design.  

It can serve as a **template** for projects that require a clean, reusable, and modern authentication UI.
